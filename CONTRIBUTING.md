## Versioning

We use `semantic versioning` for our git tags/releases. After each tag, you should use [Github Changelog Generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) to update the Changelog file.

## Documentation

Any major/minor release should be accompanied by an update to the PHPDoc as well as a regeneration of the `docs/` directory.
